### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I love lizards and enjoy creating software for microcontrollers. Building stuff that interfaces specialized hardware in any way is my main interest, even though I like playing around with computers in general.

I do <i>not</i> own some of the accounts under the name "antongecko" on other social media platforms - to contact me, make sure to do so through github (or any links provided from here)

Here is a picture of my lizard Leo :)
